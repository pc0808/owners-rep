    What is construction management?
</span></h2>
<p>
    For starters, construction management is an utility service often specialized in handling larger construction projects, but not neccessarily.
    The primary intention of construction management regards a company extending a seasoned project manager who acts as an <em>owner's representative</em> for the property owner or estate.
</p>

    What is an <em>owner's representative</em>?
</span></h2>
<p>
    An owner's representative fundamentally assists the property's renovation or construction in place of the owner or estate. 
    Similar to a general contractor, owner's reps regulate and hire subcontractors during the procedural labor of construction, but their responsibilities involve far more oversight.
    Their tasks can include, but are not limited to, selecting project sites, ensuring proper licensing and permits for the project, overseeing safety, deciding on 
    architectural and design choices, in addition to all facets of the actual construction.

    Compared to general contractor, an owner's representative asserts more weight in the decision making process.

<h2><span>
    Why hire an <em>owner's representative</em>?
</span></h2>
<p>
    If you are a property owner or project manager who desires a more hands-on approach to construction or renovation, or are considering smaller construction touchups,
    consider simply hiring general contracting assistance.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, for those who seek assistance on every facet of the construction process, an owner's representative might be a better fit for you.
    If you are not knowledgable about legal fees and regulations, safety management protocols, or the proper steps to securing licensing/property rights, an owner's representative 
    is a especially suitable aide for you.
    In scenarios where resources are limited or restricted, owner's representatives, on your behalf may swiftly decide on appropriate budgeting allocations.

<p>
    For those who represent a good fit, owner's representatives provide a valuable asset in terms of acclimation and skill level in the industry. Often times, homeowners, business 
    owners, or any interested parties, feel unfit to decide on matters regarding property acquisition, and its respective development or renovation. Owner's representatives, on the
    other hand, bridge that barrier of knowledgable and make sure to speak for your interests during the entire process of property acquisition/revitalization. They ensure 
    you are handling all related matters through the appropriate means and channels, while ensuring you of quality at the end result.
